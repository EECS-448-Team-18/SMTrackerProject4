INTRODUCTION:
------------
    A browser extension tracks your social media and entertainment usage. This allows the user to set their own limits for access to those specified services.
    SMTRACKER allows us to:
      - Use presets for websites and time limits
      - Graph of internet usage based on the type of content consumed
      - Change theme between Batman mode and Flash mode
      - Send the user the notification if they reach out to limited time
